# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
This analysis is to understand who is close to retirement, what their title is, and have an idea of who could be trained up to help fill the upcoming openings. This will provide a list of titles that will be lacking and how many people will be leaving, as well as an easily searched database to list possible replacements. 
## Results
- Retiring_titles gives a short list of seven titles held by the people who are likely to be retiring soon. This would be one of the best tools to ensure upcoming hiring and promoting decisions will prepare for upcoming retirements on the broad scale.

- Unique_titless gives a list of all the individuals who are likely to be retiring soon, with information like their employee number and name as well as the title that they currently have. This would allow for searching for people with a given title and getting a list of names of potential retirees, who may be good to ask to become mentors.

- Retirement_titles is more like unique_titles, listing individuals with all their information, but this one has all the people with their previous titles listed with the current tiles that show in the previous file. This would be most useful for searching for an individual with the title you are working to replace and taking more of their previous titles to give you an idea of where to look for people who are more likely to be eligible for the desired promotion.

- Mentorship_eligability pulls from a different subset of people, and this cam be immensely useful after you have a few titles where you intend to find people to mentor and promote to fill upcoming openings. By selecting only the people who have the title you’re looking for and ordering the results by something like the hire date, the returned list would be reasonable candidates, organized by a metric that should be somewhat indicative of how likely they are to merit a promotion.

## Summary
The number of people available for mentorship would not be the issue. Looking at the tables made to describing those who are likely to retire shows that there are more than 90,000 people who are available to become mentors. The thing that is far more likely to become a problem is that there isn’t even one tenth of the number of retirees in the list of those available for mentorship. Although this may be more than enough to ensure that there are willing mentors for all those eligible to be mentored, it would probably be better to have a strategy to be able to hire people into some of the openings. 

In order to have an idea about which titles are more pressing to replace those who will be retiring, it would be useful to make a table for the total number of people with each title and another version that shows the percent of each title that will be retiring. This would give a better idea of which titles are going to need replacements more so than others. The other tables that could be useful would include a table for a certain title that searches for the people who are retiring and currently have that title then list all their previous titles. That would allow for a grouped table that lists the previous titles with how many of those employees held that title before the one the table focuses on. A different idea that would be equally challenging to make would be a list of titles with the average number of titles held before their current position.

No mater what more information is acquired, this is enough to point out that the upcoming wave of retirees is a concern more so in the need to have more replacement than take the time to ensure that there are enough mentors.
